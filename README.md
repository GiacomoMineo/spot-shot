Application for location communication

The platforms that support our app:

* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
* [FireBase](https://www.firebase.com/) keeps our messages
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) lets us browse user contacts
* [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) to build the Android application

---------
The application [website](http://spot-shot-app.herokuapp.com) runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and implements very few code differences from the mobile native apps.
