=========

Application for location communication

The platforms that support our app:

* AngularJS application
* FireBase keeps our messages
* Facebook lets us browse user contacts
* Phonegap to build the Android application

---------
The app is also built for the [web](http://spot-shot-app.herokuapp.com), with very few code differences.
